QUEUE OPERATIONS – TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY

Queue (FIFO) implemented using Linked List or Array

Diagram:
Front                               Rear
 ↓                                   ↓
[10] -> [20] -> [30] -> nil

1️⃣ EnQueue (Insert)
   - Description: Insert element at the rear
   - Diagram:
       Before: Front -> 10 -> 20
       After : Front -> 10 -> 20 -> 30
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

2️⃣ DeQueue (Remove)
   - Description: Remove element from the front
   - Diagram:
       Before: Front -> 10 -> 20 -> 30
       After : Front -> 20 -> 30
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

3️⃣ Peek
   - Description: View front element
   - Diagram:
       Front element = 10
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

4️⃣ IsEmpty
   - Description: Check if queue is empty
   - Diagram:
       front == nil  → Queue is empty
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

5️⃣ Size
   - Description: Get number of elements in queue
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

6️⃣ Display
   - Description: Print elements from front to rear
   - Diagram:
       Front -> 10 -> 20 -> 30 <- Rear
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

KEY RULE:
- Insert at Rear
- Remove from Front
- Follows FIFO (First In First Out)

QUEUE OPERATIONS – TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY TABLE

+-----------+-------------------------------+-----------------+------------------+
| Operation | Description                   | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
+-----------+-------------------------------+-----------------+------------------+
| EnQueue   | Insert element at rear        | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| DeQueue   | Remove element from front     | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Peek     | View front element             | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| IsEmpty  | Check if queue is empty        | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Size     | Get number of elements         | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Display  | Print all elements             | O(n)            | O(1)             |
+-----------+-------------------------------+-----------------+------------------+

Notes:
- Queue follows FIFO (First In First Out)
- Insertion happens at Rear
- Deletion happens at Front
