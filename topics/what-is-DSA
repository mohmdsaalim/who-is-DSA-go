Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental concept in computer science that focuses on organizing,
storing, and processing data efficiently. Data structures define how data is arranged and accessed, while 
algorithms provide step-by-step instructions to solve problems using that data. Together, DSA helps programmers 
write optimized, scalable, and efficient code, improves problem-solving skills, and plays a crucial role in 
technical interviews and real-world software development.
