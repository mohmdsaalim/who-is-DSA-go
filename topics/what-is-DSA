Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental concept in computer science that focuses on organizing,
storing, and processing data efficiently.

Data structures define how data is arranged and accessed, while algorithms provide step-by-step instructions 
to solve problems using that data. Together, DSA helps programmers 

write optimized, scalable, and efficient code, improves problem-solving skills, and plays a crucial role in 
technical interviews and real-world software development.


     Time Complixity

// constant time complixity O(1)
// Linear time complixity O(n)
// Quatratic time complixity O(n*n)


     Space complixity


//            ARRAY
// they are out of bound exeption
// There must be continuoes memory location for array otherwise not possible
// big o notation = 
 initail stage O(n) S, T // space complixity and time complixity

// - SET
space time complitxity = O(1)ST, when use for loop the time was O(n)

// - GET 
 - INIT 
 
 - TRAVERSE.  O(1)S, O(n)T
 There is no change in space complixity means becouse there no usecase when just cheching the arrays 
 but here is an time complixxity is happens loop running time // input is 10 loop is 10rounds wghen 10000 it will runs 10000times so they will take time
 
  - INSSERT 
  O(n)T
  O(n)S

  - DELETE
O(n)ST
